A [KOReader user patch](https://github.com/koreader/koreader/wiki/User-patches) that adds
**Entity Footnotes** to [ultimatejimmy/xray.koplugin](https://github.com/ultimatejimmy/xray.koplugin):
it underlines AI-identified characters, historical figures, locations, and terms directly in
the reading text, and shows the AI-written description in a tap-to-reveal popup - the same
in-text interaction the plugin already has for unit conversions. Scanning runs as a chunked,
non-blocking background task so page turns stay responsive.

See [ultimatejimmy/xray.koplugin#100](https://github.com/ultimatejimmy/xray.koplugin/pull/100)
for the full background: this started as a PR against the plugin itself, but the maintainer
preferred it ship as an optional user patch rather than a permanent part of the plugin, since
the scan has to re-run every time the AI finds new entities (not just once at book open), and
that's more than they want to guarantee UX for on all e-ink devices. This patch takes that
route: it doesn't fork or modify xray.koplugin at all, it just monkey-patches the plugin's
class table at runtime, the same technique xray.koplugin already uses internally for its own
unit-converter underline/tap handling.

All credit for X-Ray itself goes to [ultimatejimmy](https://github.com/ultimatejimmy) - this
repo only adds the one patch file.

## Requirements

- KOReader
- [xray.koplugin](https://github.com/ultimatejimmy/xray.koplugin) installed and set up (API
  key configured, at least one character/location/term fetched for the book you're reading)

## Install

1. Download [`2-xray-entity-footnotes.lua`](https://github.com/Dukko/xray.koplugin/releases/latest)
   from the latest release.
2. Copy it into `koreader/patches/2-xray-entity-footnotes.lua`.
3. Restart KOReader.
4. Open a book, tap the X-Ray menu, and look for **Entity Footnotes** to enable it, pick
   categories, or trigger a manual rescan.

Since this is a patch, not a plugin, it updates independently of xray.koplugin. Updating
xray.koplugin itself (through its own built-in updater or manually) won't touch or remove
this file, and updating this patch never touches xray.koplugin.

## Updating

Replace `koreader/patches/2-xray-entity-footnotes.lua` with the newest version from
[Releases](https://github.com/Dukko/xray.koplugin/releases) and restart KOReader. Watch this
repo (Watch -> Custom -> Releases) on GitHub to get notified when a new version is out.

## Known limitations

- English-only. As an external patch it can't add entries to xray.koplugin's own
  localization files, so menu/notification text falls back to English regardless of your
  KOReader language.
- Scanning is chunked to avoid blocking input, but on slower e-ink devices with very large
  entity lists it can still be briefly perceptible.
- Matching is case-sensitive (a name only matches its original capitalization) to avoid
  false positives from common words or names that are substrings of unrelated words (e.g.
  "black" the color vs. "Black" the character, or "han" inside "than"). As a trade-off,
  occurrences in ALL-CAPS text (some chapter headers or title pages) won't be underlined.
