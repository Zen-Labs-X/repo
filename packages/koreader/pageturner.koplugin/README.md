A KoReader plugin that allows remote page turning via UDP commands from a Page Turning Companion app or any UDP client.

2. Move the `pageturner.koplugin` folder into KOReader’s `plugins/` directory.
3. Restart KOReader.
4. The plugin will appear under `Tools` as `Page Turner`

[Page Turner Companion source code](https://github.com/TomasDiLeo/koreader_pageturner_companion)

The plugin has been tested on KOReader 2025.10 on a Kindle PW5,

## Usage

1. Open the plugin menu from KoReader's menu: `Tools → PageTurner`
2. Press `Start Service`. When the plugin's service starts you will see an Info screen detailing the IP of your device and the UDP port it is using (8134 by default). You can press `Show network info` to see this information again

## Notes

- **Port**: This plugin uses the same port that the Calibre plugin uses to connect. To avoid problems press `Stop service` on the Page Turner plugin before using the Calibre Plugin to transfer files. Or configure the plugin to use another port (Note that some ports are not opened on certain devices, I used the port that Calibre uses because it works)
- **Network**: Make sure both the KOReader device and your Android phone are connected to the same network. You can look at your network information by going to `Settings → Network → Network info`.
- **Hotspot**: This plugin and app works via the network and does not require connection to the internet. You can use a mobile Hotspot to control the plugin.

Confirmed IP's are stored, you can forget IPs by going to `Tools → Page Turner → IP Managment` and deleting the IP

## Commands for custom implementations

The plugin accepts the following UDP commands (case-sensitive):
- `REQUEST` to request confirmation from the plugin, upon confirmation the plugin saves the IP as a trusted IP that autoconnects and sends an `ACCEPTED` command back. If you deny the request the plugin send a `DENIED` command
- `NEXT` or `PREV` to control the page turning
