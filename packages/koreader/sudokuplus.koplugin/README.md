## ✨ Features

- **🧠 17 Human Deductive Technique Families, 19 Selectable IDs**: Complete logical solver ported from `rustoku` and HoDoKu logic, with AIC split into X-Chain, XY-Chain, and General AIC for targeted practice. Every puzzle is 100% uniquely solvable through human deduction without guessing or brute-force trial-and-error:
  - *Basic*: Naked/Hidden Singles, Naked/Hidden Pairs, Triples, and Quads
  - *Intersections*: Locked Candidates (Pointing & Claiming)
  - *Wings & Fish*: X-Wing, Swordfish, Jellyfish, Skyscraper, W-Wing, XY-Wing, XYZ-Wing
  - *Chains*: X-Chain, XY-Chain, Alternating Inference Chains (AIC)
- **🎯 6 Exact Difficulty Tiers & Custom Practice**:
  - Standard tiers: Beginner, Easy, Medium, Hard, Master, and Expert, backed by an optimized algorithmic generator with 5 symmetry modes.
  - Custom Strategy Practice mode: choose any combination of target techniques from Medium to Expert to practice specific solving patterns on demand.
  - Exact-tier contract: puzzles strictly match the requested difficulty without falling back to nearby tiers.
- **💡 Progressive 3-Stage Hint Engine**:
  1. **Identify**: Teaches you the next logical technique to look for.
  2. **Highlight**: Highlights the pattern cells, pincers, and candidate eliminations directly on your board.
  3. **Apply**: Executes all candidate eliminations for the technique instance in a single atomic step.
- **⚡ E-Ink Optimized Display**:
  - Region-bounded per-cell partial refreshes with zero full-screen flashing during normal tap-and-play.
  - High-contrast typography and night-mode safe themes.
- **📊 Rich Analytics, Seed Sharing & Game History**:
  - Track total games, win rates, per-difficulty completion times, and active streaks.
  - Identify your most-missed solving techniques.
  - Interactive game log with mini-board previews, formatted seed display (`Seed: 4354 5433 …`), required solving techniques, and multi-modal previous/next game navigation (swipe, arrow keys, page buttons).
  - Seed-based puzzle replay system to retry specific boards or share puzzles.
- **✏️ Pen & Pencil Controls**:
  - Fast single-tap digit entry, hardware button cycling, and dual-mode pencil notes.
  - Optional "Auto-fill notes" and live rule-violation detection.
  - On-demand "Check Board" solver verification with clear strikethrough feedback.
  - Full Undo / Redo history.
- **💾 Recoverable Sessions**: Automatic checkpoints on pause, suspend, close, and reset protect your progress. Failed writes keep the live session available with explicit Retry or Discard choices.
- **🌐 Multilingual**: Built-in localization support (English, German included out-of-the-box).

## 🎮 How to Play

- **Select Cell**: Tap any empty or filled cell on the 9×9 grid.
- **Enter Digits**: Tap numbers 1–9 on the bottom number bar, or cycle through digits with hardware page-turn / arrow buttons.
- **Pencil Notes**: Toggle the **Notes** button (pencil icon) to enter candidate notes, or long-press a cell to quickly write a note. Placing a definitive digit automatically prunes notes from intersecting rows, columns, and 3×3 boxes.
- **Check Board**: Tap **Check** to verify your board against the solution. Incorrect entries are struck through in ink and keep a shaded background until corrected.
- **Hints**: Tap **Hint** whenever you are stuck to receive progressive guidance on the next logical technique.
- **Custom Practice**: Tap **New game** &rarr; **Custom…** to select and practice specific solving strategies.
- **Browse & Replay**: Visit **Statistics** &rarr; select any game from the log to view its solution, seed, and required techniques, browse past games with `◀`/`▶` (or swipe), or tap **Play again** to replay the exact puzzle.

### Development Commands

```sh
# Run the local KOReader emulator with live symlinked plugin
./dev.sh

# Run all 49 plugin specs (40 core, then 9 isolated frontend)
./dev.sh test

# Run one test category
./dev.sh test --core
./dev.sh test --frontend

# Run a specific test
./dev.sh test tests/unit/sudoku_hints_spec.lua

# Run manifest, isolation, package, release, and workflow contract tests
./dev.sh test-tooling

# Check code formatting and static analysis (luacheck + stylua)
./dev.sh lint

# Apply automatic code formatting
./dev.sh fmt

# Extract translatable strings into gettext catalog
./dev.sh pot

# Deploy directly to a USB-connected Kobo
./dev.sh deploy

# Package clean release zip archive
./tools/package_release.sh
# Outputs dist/sudokuplus.koplugin.zip and its .sha256 sidecar

# Publish after dating CHANGELOG.md and committing the release version
git tag v1.1.0
git push origin v1.1.0
```

Stable `vX.Y.Z` tags run every CI and package gate before publishing. If a tag
was placed on the wrong commit, force-moving and pushing it reruns the gates and
updates the existing release and assets.
